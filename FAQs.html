                        o Model Clauses: we rely in the Commission’s model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries (i.e. the standard contractual clauses) pursuant to Decision 2010/87/EU when transferring your information to our US service providers who do not adhere to the US Department of Commerce's EU-US Privacy Shield.</br>
                        <br>7. SECURITY
                        Keeping you and your personal information secure is very important to us. We take a number of reasonable steps to try to protect the personal information that you provide, including:
                        • Using a Transport Layer Secure (TLS) to encrypt the personal data that you send us during the order process (including any financial information such as credit or debit card details).
                        • Requiring you to establish a unique username and password to access your account on our website.
                        • Not keeping details of your credit or debit card that would enable any third party to transact using that credit or debit card (such as your CVV number).
                        • Regularly monitoring our servers and IT systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks. Unfortunately, despite this, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of your personal data transmitted to or through our website, and any such transmission is at your own risk. In particular, please keep in mind that if you voluntarily disclose personal information through other means of communication than the website in a non-protected environment (such as through email, SMS, online messages) then that information can be collected and used by others outside of our or your control.</br>
                        <br>8. HOW LONG WILL YOU USE MY INFORMATION FOR?
                        We retain the data you provide to us for as long as you have your account with us and thereafter for such period as you may have questions or a claim in relation to our services, notwithstanding any superior retention period that we may be obliged to observe in accordance with legal requirements applicable to us.
                        In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data as set out below.
                        After you have terminated your use of our services, we may store your information in an aggregated and anonymized format.</br>
                        <br>9. WHAT ARE MY PRIVACY RIGHTS?
                        You have certain rights in relation to the personal data we hold about you, which we detail below. Some of these only apply in certain circumstances as set out in more detail below. We also set out how to exercise those rights. Please note that we will require you to verify your identity before responding to any requests to exercise your rights and that can include asking a set of security questions to ensure it is you. When you have appointed someone else to do the request on your behalf, that person and/or organization needs to show a valid power of attorney issued by you. We must respond to a request by you to exercise those rights without undue delay and at least within one month (although this may be extended by a further two months in certain circumstances). To exercise any of your rights, please contact us at privacy@olaha.com.
                        • Access: you have the right to know whether we process personal data about you, and if we do, to access data we hold about you and certain information about how we use it and who we share it with (including the categories of personal data we share with businesses for their direct marketing uses and the names and addresses of those businesses). Please note that in “My Account” dashboards, you can see information about you, namely your account details (such as name, email, phone number, date of birth, the addresses you use for billing and shipping, your order history and shopping preferences).
                        You can also request a copy of your information. If you require more than one copy of the data we hold about you, we may charge a reasonable administration fee.
                        We may not provide you with certain personal data if providing it would interfere with another’s rights (e.g. where providing the personal data we hold about you would reveal information about another person) or where another exemption applies.
