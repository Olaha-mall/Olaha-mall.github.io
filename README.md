As assignment required us to program a e-commerce website. We named our mall Olaha.

For our product page theres 2 pages name :

1. 
https://olaha-mall.github.io/nike-product-detail.html

2.
https://olaha-mall.github.io/aldo-product-detail.html

Our hardcoded Account for Log-in page :

1.
Username: Sam123@gmail.com
Password: 123123Abc!

2.
username: "0123456789@gmail.com"
password: "1234567890Abc!"

PHP assignment

1.Due to some bug we couldn't find out the solution on debugging on password_verify() for admin CMS login. So we implement a hardcore account for CMS admin Log in username: admin ; password: test. 

2.The rest of the install.php admin register account works find. The data file save outside of directory root folder.

3.Register Form works fine somehow for both register and login.
